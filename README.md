# Idea

Make a program that searches the web for picture based on some keywords by utilizing open source object recognition.

Ideally I'd like to make it into a Discord bot that spouts funny pictures of squirrels.


# Status

Using ImageAI for recognizing "fox_squirrel"s.
Unofficial list of supported class names (seems quite accurate): https://github.com/ageron/handson-ml/blob/master/datasets/inception/imagenet_class_names.txt
ImageAI and utilized recognition models: https://github.com/OlafenwaMoses/ImageAI/blob/master/imageai/Prediction/README.md

Source images are downloaded from Google image search using *selenium*.
